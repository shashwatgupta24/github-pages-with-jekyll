I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my Life. Here I will give you some of the life lessons that I have learned till now.
- Never ignore your mental health
- Start exercising. This will help you build confidence and you will start loving yourself 
- I know that coding is hard to do. But keep learning about it. It can be of some help in the future
- Have atleast one hobby. If possible, try to make money out of it. Its not compulsory though.
- Read books. Whether it is fiction or non fiction.
- Help others (This one is most important)
- At last, Love yourself and others around you to the fullest
